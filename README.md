Quickdojo was created to help Coderdojo's get coding quickly.  

:: No finicky setups, just code & publish ::  
:: Like Thimble only no distractions ::  
:: Like Notepad but with publish to web ::  
:: Login with G+ to get dedicated folders ::  

I have built this editor for our Coderdojo in Dingle,    
it is also my project for the Eircom Junior Spiders 2015  
I am so happy that it got shortlisted and can't wait for the final results!  
I plan on adding the following features to this app:
* New styles
* Quicker loading times
* Ace.js (line numbers, syntax highlighting, error warnings and more)
* There is a working version at http://quickdojo.com  

Things I got help with:
* The PHP
* Domain stuff  

You will need to change the following credentials:    
if you want to download/use this on your own, make sure to change the following values to yours:  
* ```javascript /*your domain number goes here*/``` to 1234 etc.  
* ```php /*your domain number goes here*/``` to 5678 etc.  
* ```html data-clientid="YOUR-CLIENT-ID.apps.googleusercontent.com"``` to ```html data-clientid="12345678910.apps.googleusercontent.com"```
