> Shortlisted for Eircom Web Spiders 2015  

I have built this editor for our Coderdojo in Dingle  
It is also my project for the Eircom Web Spiders 2015  
I am so happy that it got shortlisted and can't wait for the final results!  
I do plan on adding new versions to this app:
* New styles
* Quicker loading times
* Ace.js (line numbers, syntax highlighting, error warnings and more)
* This repository has personal codes censored for privacy reasons but to see working version please visit http://quickdojo.com
